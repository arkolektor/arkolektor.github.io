<h1>My website</h1>
<p>This is my first website. My name is Ari Kolektor. My tudengikood on 223045IADB. I don't know what else to say, so I'll tell you about the recipe for stuffed cabbage rolls. So, we choose cabbage, my head, we remove the top hard leaves.In a large saucepan boil the water. Cabbage cabbage is punctured with a large fork and dipped in boiling water for 3-5 minutes. Time to choose yourself — the top sheets should become soft, but in no case do not creep into pieces.
We take out the head out of the water and take off some upper leaves. As soon as you feel that the leaves do not «go» freely, stop, otherwise you will just rip them.If necessary cut the thick places that are located at the base of the cabbage leaf.
Repeat the procedure for the next layer of leaves and the next head of cabbage — do so until it will be possible to remove smooth leaves of medium size.
Minced meat for classic cabbage rollsMeat for my cabbage rolls, cut off excess fat, film.Twist on the meat grinder. To save time, you can buy ready-made minced meat, if you practice cooking home-made foods from convenience stores.
Rice boil until half cooked. If you take the fully cooked rice, after extinguishing it will turn into a cushy mass. Raw rice «will take» a maximum of juice from meat, as a result of which it will become dry and hard.In a bowl of minced meat, lay out the rice.
It is worthwhile to understand that the quantity «1 cup» indicated in the list of ingredients for preparation of cabbage rolls is rather arbitrary. Rice can be taken a little more or slightly less, depending on what kind of stuffing in cabbage rolls you like. With these proportions, cereals and carrots with onions will be more than meat, and the dish will turn out to be vegetable rather than meat. If you prefer a more thorough, «brutal» version of cabbage rolls, you can reduce the amount of rice or increase the amount of minced meat.Carrots are cleaned, rubbed on a grater...</p>
